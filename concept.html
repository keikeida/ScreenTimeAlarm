		<p style="color:white"><strong>IDEA</strong></p>
		<p style="color:white"> Screen Time Alarm is exactly like it says in its name. It is and alarm for when you have used your phone for too long so we can prevent the frequesnt issue of phone addiction.

Recently, there have been programmes that calculate the hours people have been using their phones as a new awareness programme but there are not many apps that directly impacts users from getting off their phones.

With this concept in mind Screen Time Alarm is an app that will analyse the hours of the users time of looking at the screen and alarm them to get off their screens so they do not damage their eyes or stop getting distracted. </p>

		<p style="color:white"><strong>TARGET AUDIENCE</strong></p>
		<p style="color:white"> The target audience can lead to be a wide range of people. From little kids to the wise. Electronic devices are used for education purposes, workplaces, and for daily use for anyone at anytime therefore it is highly addictive and inevitable to face the screen for a reasonable amount of time.  

Research shows that in America, the population spends over 5 hours averagely on their phones. And in further detailed research it is found thaat some young adults spend over 12 hours on their phones daily. 
This app would be most functional for these teenagers to spend more time away from their phones and spend more time away from damaging their eyes and often procrastination and distraction. </p>
